* Flakewhale
much of the included code is from [[https://github.com/mmai/funkwhale-flake][mmai's work on creating a flake for funkwhale]].

while I appreciate the work that mmai has done, I prefer tracking upstream funkwhale updates more closely, and think there's a few changes to the flake itself that would make it easier to use.

thus, this repository was born.
* TODO example configuration
coming as soon as I set this up myself!
